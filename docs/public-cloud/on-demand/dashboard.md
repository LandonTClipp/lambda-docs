## Launch, restart, and terminate instances

### Launch instances

To launch an instance:

1.  Click [**Instances**
    :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/instances){target="_blank"}
    in the left sidebar of the dashboard.

      Then, click **Launch instance** at the top-right of the dashboard.

3.  Click the region in which you want to launch the instance.

4.  Click the [persistent storage file
    system](#create-and-manage-persistent-storage-file-systems) that you want to
    attach to your instance.

      If you don't want to or can't attach a persistent storage file system to
      your instance, click **Don’t attach a filesystem**.

5.  Select the [SSH key](#add-generate-and-delete-ssh-keys) that you want to use
    for your instance. Then, click **Launch instance**.

    !!! tip

        You can [add additional SSH
        keys](getting-started.md#is-it-possible-to-use-more-than-one-ssh-key) to your instance once
        your instance has launched.

6.  Review the license agreements and terms of service. If you agree to them,
    click **I agree to the above** to launch your instance.

In the dashboard, you should now see your instance listed. Once your instance
has finished booting, you’ll be provided with the details needed to begin using
your instance.

    You can also [launch instances using the Cloud
    API](../cloud-api.md#launching-instances).

    You can also use the Cloud API to [get details of a running
    instance](../cloud-api.md#getting-details-of-a-specific-instance).

restart. Then, click **Restart** at the top-right of the dashboard.

### Terminate instances

Terminate instances by clicking the checkboxes next to the instances you want to
